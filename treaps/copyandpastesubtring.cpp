/*
problem: 
    Given a string, your task is to process operations where you cut a substring and paste it to the end of the string. What is the final string after all the operations?
    Input
    The first input line has two integers n and m: the length of the string and the number of operations. The characters of the string are numbered 1,2,\dots,n.
    The next line has a string of length n that consists of characters Aâ€“Z.
    Finally, there are m lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers a and b: you cut a substring from position a to position b.
    Output
    Print the final string after all the operations.
    Constraints

    1  n, m <=2 * 10^5
    1  a  and b <= n

    Example
    Input:
    7 2
    AYBABTU
    3 5
    3 5

    Output:
    AYABTUB

Solution: 
    We will use implicit treaps to represent the array. For each operation, divide
    it into two phases: cut and paste. For the cut phase, we split the array into
    three parts: 
    [1, a) , [a, b] , and (b, n]
    . This can be accomplished using
    two split operations. For the paste phase, we can rearrange the sections such
    that we merge them in the order 
    [1, a),(b, n],[a, b]. This can be done
    using two merge operations.
