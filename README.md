# MyCpLibrary

MyCpLibrary is a compilation of various algorithms and data structures that I have utilized to solve problems on competitive programming platforms. The library is primarily written in C++ and aims to provide a collection of efficient solutions for a wide range of algorithmic challenges.

## Features

- A diverse set of algorithms and data structures.
- Solutions for common programming problems and challenges.
- Focus on competitive programming efficiency and correctness.

## Contents

The library is organized into different folders, each dedicated to a specific category of algorithms or techniques:

- `HEAVY_LIGHT_DECOMPOSITION`: Heavy-Light Decomposition techniques.
- `TCPC`: Solutions for the latest TCPC (Tunisian Collegiate Programming Contest).
- ... 

Feel free to explore each folder for specific solutions, code snippets.

## Usage

You can use this library as a reference for implementing algorithms and techniques in your own programming projects, especially if you work with C++. The solutions provided are optimized for competitive programming scenarios and can be adapted to solve various coding challenges.
